                     have add_item():s which had similar names (ie. 'crack',
                    'cracks'). this was caused by the 'intelligence' of room

Jan 12 20:21 yorkaturr: removed about 30 unnecessary feelings

                        ortals out of rooms

Jan 14 00:29 dazzt: new filesecurity system installed, if you have difficulties
                     reading / writing files you should have access 'bug' them
                    to me

Jan 14 00:43 dazzt: if you want to exchange code to other immortals use /open/

                        random(100) hps from him/her

                     that changes a filename to a true filename, e.g.
                    ~/workroom.c results /home/alcal/workroom.c etc.   Use
                    this instead of resolve_path()!

Jan 15 22:56 dazzt: fixed a small bug in add_money(), hilltop bank reseted
Jan 16 12:23 alcal: I tracked down the problem with the world map, it has come 
                    with the access system, as /world/virtual/server.c cannot
                    read the map or the terrain files when other people cause
                    it to load a new room than with people that have access,
                    so if a normal player (or a demigod as me) has a starting
                    location on the map and the room hasn't already been
                    loaded, the room will not be loaded. try 'cc y53x46' if
                    youre not a god.

Jan 22 22:42 dazzt: Blocking added to monsters, use function add_block("<direct
                    ion>", "<blocking message">) to give monster this ability.
                    To create custom blockers, function query_block(string)
                    will be called with the direction of movement as an
                    argument. The function has to return 1 if direction has to
                    be blocked and 0 if movement is allowed. You can also
                    remove blocking direction with remove_block("<direction>")
                    function

Jan 22 22:46 dazzt: Btw you can also use blocking to prevent some commands to b
                    e used in the room (eg. disallow taking specific object)
                    as long as monster is present

Jan 22 23:00 dazzt: query_block_message(string dir) apply added. This function 
                    should return the message you wish to use or "" for no
                    message. If you return 0, the default message asssociated
                    with block direction is used.

Jan 23 09:46 namhas: corpse object revised
Jan 23 10:22 namhas: added set command. you can now set your rows and columns, 
                     long descriptions should be wrapped by user's columns,

                     query_quality() functions added. now hp/max_hp settings
                     from items are obsolete as well as query_weight(). For
                     now set_material(), set_dimensions() determines the
                     value, weight and hit points of the item and
                     set_quality() may be used to improve those values,
                     however set_quality() is used automatically to set
                     randomly quality of 10-30 and setting new quality should
                     be used only in special purposes. never set quality to
                     100 until the item is magically enhanced.

                     e there! set_area() is determined automatically and

                     room.
