  CENDOR AND THE WINTERKILL MUD ARE NOW OUR ENEMIES.

  Cendor is the adminstrator of a useless bat/zombie clone called Winterkill
  MUD. One beautiful day, Winterkill MUD and Majik MURPE joined together.
  It was a mistake. I thought that Cendor had changed and wasn't such a
  bastard anymore as his reputation tells. Cendor had before copied ideas
  and code from other MUDs to his own without permission, breaking all
  copyright rules. Now on the 20th day of Xudal, Cendor showed me again
  how untrustworthy he actually is, and you can guess what happened.

  If you are on Majik's side, please spread the word about how untrustworthy
  Cendor is, and maybe we can save someone from his evil plans.
