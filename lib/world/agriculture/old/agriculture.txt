This is proposed agriculture system : Pook & Madrid.

BASIC IDEAS
-----------

1.  In each homeland will be a farming guild for all citizens to join
    if he/she likes.  

2.  Each homeland will have a limited number of farm plots from which
    crops will be able to be grown from.

3.  When mud opens all plots will be in hands of goventment and for 
    sale for aspiring farmers.

4.  The reason for this will be each homeland or town will try to become
    a self sufficient land meaning it must feed itself.  Buying food
    from other cities than your homeland will be at least very 
    expensive.  Hence, making food a valuable commodity and a reason
    for this system.

5.  There will be many crops and many different skills that each farmer
    can learn but not all types of crops should be allowed in all towns
    giving each land a demographic uniquness.  Some crops will be more
    valuable than others and such.

6.  Basic assumption is that each farmer is citizen of the said town or
    homland and he owns a dwelling i.e. house or hole in that town.


IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

1st.  You must buy a dwelling in a town or homeland.

2nd.  You can then join the farmers guild of that town.
      This will include training all necessary skills for farming and
      buying all necessary equiptment.

3rd.  You must buy a farmland plot in which you will grow you crops.
      Each room object will be equivelent to one acre of a certain
      crop.

     There will be many skills and such for farming guild that will be 
     documented later, but wanted to throw out the basic conecpt before
     we get started.
