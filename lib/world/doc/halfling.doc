Backround of area:

This area is simply the home of most halflings. It is the area in which players who choose the
Halfling race will start. It is located in an area of the plains.  The Shire, as the residents
call it, is not normally visited by other races, however they welcome anyone who comes peace-
fully and without malicious intent.  The halflings have lived here as long as they can remember.
