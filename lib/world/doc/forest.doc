Backround of Area:
The forest has been inhabited by the elves for ages. The goblins and Kane have invaded it and 
are trying to take it for themselves. The elves are almost defeated, except Filonius, an elven
mage, is still inside their sacred tower. Filonius has put a strange mist around the tower to
stop the easily frightened goblins and stupid skeletons from entering it. Kane, being a mage
also, is not afraid and is torturing Filonius in the top of the tower, trying to get him to 
relase the mist. The elves are trying to deafeat the goblins by using the stealty advantage in
the forest and their knowledge of the secret rope bridges above the forest. The goblins, on the
other hand, are trying to defeat the elves by sheer force and by destorying the forest which 
they have set on fire.

Area quest:
The final goal of the area quest is to defeat Kane in the top of the tower. Without Kane's 
superiour knowledge, the goblins will have no hope of defeating the elves. There are two general
ways to complete the quest.
For good aligned players the proper way is to:
First ask Elvanna about the quest and then accept it. She will then provide the player with a
silver pendant and tell him/her to show it to her son, Porthios. When the player has done this
Porthios will give him/her the obsidian moon fragment and the general locations of the other
three, as well as more info about solving the quest. Next, the player should seek out Rayak, 
the goblin king, slay him and attain the wooden moon fragment as well as the key to the door
of the tower. Then, the player should proceed to the tower, where he/she will find the last
two moon fragments in the first room, under some tables. Now, the player needs to assemble
the pieces and create the moon shield. With the shield the player will be able to enter the
topmost room of the tower where Filonius and Kane are located. The player will kill Kane and 
recieve a golden ring from Filonius for his/her actions. Kane has been defeated and the quest
has been solved.

Note: When Rayak is slain his head can be taken and given to Prince Gladnil in return for 
100 silver pieces. This is not neccessary to solve the quest, just to get some money.
