IMMORTING

        Yes, we need new immortals to help us with this huge project.
        You don't need to have previous experience on coding or
        anything. You only need to be diligent, very diligent because
        we don't need idling immortals, we wipe out such things.

        Find a old hermit and ask application from him and fill it.
