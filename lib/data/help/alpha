ALPHA TESTING PHASE

  Majik MURPE is in alpha testing phase. The next phase is beta and
  when we are beta we can almost say this is ready and not need testing
  any more. To get this to the beta phase we need _many_ alpha testers
  who are willing to help us with the development by testing everything
  and reporting bugs, ideas, typos and suggestions. Tell us everything
  you see disgusting here and we shall fix it.

  Are you willing to test? Go ahead, otherwise come back later ;>
