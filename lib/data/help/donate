     We  accept  donations,  we  actually _n_e_e_d donations. By
donating money you support our project and can receive  spe-
cial  _w_i_s_h_e_s,  like better stats for your character. We have
not yet decided the policy  for  the  wishes,  but  we  will
before  we  go  to the beta testing phase. All donations are
logged so we will never forget your donation.

     The money you donate is used only for Majik's  develop-
ment,  for example in the future we are planning to buy many
times  faster  server  machine  using  the  money  which  is
donated. Even smallest donation is accepted.

You can send your money using standard mail:

    Tommi Leino
    Liinakkokuja 3 D 13
    01200 Vantaa

Or directly to our bank account in Finland:

     Currently  we have received total of 400 FIM (about
76 USD) money from the Majik's users and developers. The
machine  and internet connection including 10mb/s ether-
net cable is donated for our use by  _N_e_t_t_i  _F_i_n_l_a_n_d  _O_y.
