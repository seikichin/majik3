The  IRC  (Internet  Relay  Chat) protocol has been designed
over a number of years for use with text based conferencing.
IRC  itself is a teleconferencing system, which (through the
use of the client- server model) is well suited  to  running
on many machines in a distributed fashion. Therefore IRC has
grown to be very popular, well over hundred thousand  people
are using it same time from different countries all over the
world.

Majik, as the first MUD/MURPE in the world has developed the
IRC client which suits on the MUD environment. This document
descibes how you can use that client program.

As your IRC client is still in alpha-testing state we  offer
only  few  commands  which  should work at least almost. You
need to first start the majik client by typing "irc", or  if
your  name  is  already  in  use you need to type "irc <your
name>", for example "irc peelo". Then  you  should  be  con-
nected  to the irc and you can send irc commands using "irc"
command for example "irc say hello" would  send  "hello"  to
the current channel where you are, for default it is #majik.
All channels start with '#' character.  The  list  of  docu-
mented working commands are:

irc say <message>
     The  command sends <message> to the current channel you
     are idling in.  For example: irc say hello

irc tell <user> <message>
     The command sends <message> to the <user> in  the  IRC.
     For example: irc tell namhas hello

irc quit
     This command disconnects you from the irc. For example:
     irc quit

irc join #<channel>
     This command lets you to change channel, or if you have
     not joined to the channel this command joins you to the
     channel. Remember IRC includes uncalculable  amount  of
     channels.  Ask good channels from other channels ;> For
     example: irc join #freenet

irc part #<channel>
     This command lets you quit some  channel.  For  example
     irc part #freenet

irc ctcp <user> <command>
     This command allows you use some special CTCP commands,

     don't worry about them, you will  not  understand  them
     because  they  are  not yet fully working, .. still you
     can receive some CTCP commands and your client  answers
     automatically to them. In the future using CTCP you can
     even send/receive files or do something else  neat  too
     :)

irc who
     This command gives you list of users on the channel you
     are idling on.  In the future this  will  include  more
     features.

Please  ask  more  help from Namhas if you didn't understand
anything.
