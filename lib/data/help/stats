Strength (STR)
     Physical  power,  amount of muscles, muscular strength.
     Strength describes the  ability  to  do  more  work  in
     shorter  time, do more damage, carry more weight and do
     things that require much energy or  work.  As  strength
     means  more  muscles,  it also affects one's ability to
     withstand more damage.

Dexterity (DEX)
     Dexterity describes the accurate handling of one's  own
     limbs  and  the ability to do detailed work (paintings,
     pick locks etc).  Dexterity also affects  your  ability
     to  react  to  things more faster.  With high dexterity
     one is able to use  small  and  throwing  weapons  more
     efficiently.

Agility (AGI)
     Agility stands for ability to coordinate one's movement
     more accurately and to keep  oneself  in  balance  when
     doing  complex  movements  or maneuvers.  It is the co-
     operation of your brain and muscles. Agility is also  a
     skill to coordinate one's strength in best possible way
     so it's easier to perform movements with less stress.

Constitution (CON)
     Condition, vitality, endurance. Skill to  continue  and
     recover.   Constitution  describes the ability to with-
     stand long-term stress and  diseases.  Constitution  is
     also  the  energy  that  keeps  one  fighting even when
     severely wounded.

Sturdiness (STU)
     Structure of the body,  ability  to  withstand  damage.
     Sturdiness  describes how sturdy and firm one's body is
     and how hard it is to break. With  sturdiness  one  can
     resist  all  types  of  damage and natural hazards like
     heat and cold for example. With good sturdiness one can
     also  concentrate  better on whatever one is doing when
     disturbed by extreme conditions.

Size (SIZ)
     Size describes one's size and mass and should be rather
     self  explanatory.   Height  and  weight are calculated
     from this with modifiers from race.

Intelligence (INT)
     Intelligence, logical  thinking,  ability  to  predict.
     Intelligence  is  the  ability  to  analyse and connect
     things together and make decisions  and  new  solutions
     that  are  based on the available information. Intelli-
     gence is also observation of things that are  happening

     around you. It is an ability of the mind.

Power (POW)
     Willpower,  tolerance  of stress, strength of the mind.
     Power is mandatory for every living being because with-
     out  any  willpower one cannot perform anything without
     external help or suggestion.  Power is the same for the
     mind  as  strength  is  for  the  body. It's especially
     important to casters as they need willpower  to  under-
     stand and control their magic powers.

Wisdom (WIS)
     Wisdom,  intuition, instincts.  Wisdom is an ability to
     understand things and make  conclusions  from  subjects
     that aren't always based on undisputable and raw infor-
     mation.  Speculation, research and questioning is  also
     part  of  wisdom.  Wise man will make his decision more
     thoroughly than super-intelligent one who only analyses
     the  data and makes his decision. Wisdom can be used to
     react things that intelligence has  helped  to  notice,
     for example go shelter when it starts raining. Wise man
     dares to guess and perhaps believe and assume.

Charisma (CHA)
     Charisma, outlook, attraction.  Charisma includes  much
     that  cannot  be  accomplished only with beautifulness.
     One  doesn't  have  to  look  beautiful  to  have  high
     charisma,  but  it  will  help.  Having a good charisma
     highly affects on how others react  to  you.  It's  the
     power  of your personality and ability to express your-
     self and manipulate others through feelings  and  empa-
     thy.
