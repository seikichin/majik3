They are a mystery to most of the other humanoid races. Some claim that
all of the Yamar race are half-elves or even elves. They are, however,
very small and lithe. All Yamar have pointed ears, much like elven
ears, but not as pronounced. They appear to be small, slender humans.
The Yamar number very few in the world, and they live in rather small
isolated groups, preferring islands and places near water. Much of their
culture is unknown to others, but they tend to drift towards the magical 
arts. They have blond or light brown hair, green, blue or even purple 
eyes, and fair beautiful skin. A typical Yamar is around 155 cm tall, 
and is weaker in physical strength than most other human races. They 
don't weigh much either, only around 35 kg on average. Yamar are, however, 
very intelligent and wise people, most of them tend to be sages and 
mystics. Yamar are known to live about 200 years.
