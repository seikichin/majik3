The Moraki are large, powerful humans. They are built strong and are big
boned, famous for their strength and sturdiness. Moraki tend to be people
of simple means, living in small villages while tending their sheep and crops.
They are often ruled and used as slaves by other races. Most of the moraki
have blond hair and blue eyes. They are a very anti-magical people and most
of them never get a change to learn the art of spell casting. They tend to 
shun magic users and somehow strangely they even resist magic itself. The 
Moraki are often satisfied with their simple and quiet lives, with occasional
fist fights in the evening. They work hard with a pure spirit. An average 
Moraki man is fairly large, around 210 cm tall and he weighs around 130 kg. 
They have a lifespan of around 60 years.
