Gnomes are the smaller counsins of dwarves. They live in the rolling hills 
and wooded valleys of Majik. They are great connoisseurs of gems and the 
best gem carvers known in the whole world. Gnomes are famous for their 
very black humor and their great magical skills. They are about 115 cm tall,
weigh 40 kg and are not as stocky as dwarves. They groom their beards very well,
although they generally favor them cut short and cropped. Gnomes are great 
leather workers and gnomish boots are a quality product every race greatly 
enjoys (except trolls). Their greatest enemies are the kobolds. They normally 
attack each other on sight. Gnomes favor colorful clothing and strange 
looking hats. They are famous for their long lasting lives, that usually
last an average of 400 years. The most famous product of the whole gnome 
race is their technology and bizarre machines. Gnomes are simply geniuses
when it comes to mechanical skills and engineering machines of different 
purpose.
