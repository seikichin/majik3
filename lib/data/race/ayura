The Ayuran people live in the chilly, cold northern lands. They are rather
small in stature, and have been hardened greatly by the unfriendly nature 
of the climate they inhabit. They live in an isolated state from the other 
races of the world. They usually have dark hair, green or grey eyes and
red-brown skin color. Ayuras are a bit shy and quiet, but they are generous 
and warm people. Most of the Ayurans make their living by hunting. They are 
formidable warriors and the Ayuran tribe shamans are well known for their
magical power. The average Ayuran man is around 160 cm tall and weighs 
around 80 kgs. They are known to have an average lifespan of around 100 years.
