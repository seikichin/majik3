This group of elves are known as the 'dark elves'. Many years ago they were
exciled into the Underdark after a long and hateful war with the other elven
sub-races. In the millennia beneath the earth, they were corrupted by the
dark secrets they managed to unearth. Their skin is almost white but their
souls dark as the night. In contrast their hair is of coal black color.
Dyanir are more slender than their surface-dwelling cousins. The Dyanir
are hated and feared by almost everyone. They possess great magical talents,
are very nimble and have an excellent perception in the underground. Because
of their long absence from sunlight normal dyanir are a bit blind when
adventuring in the daylight. Their greatest enemies are their surface
cousins. Despite the general evil disposition of this race over the
centuries, they have spawned some very rare individuals, who have left their
homelands and are eternally remembered in legends and songs because of their
valor, goodwill and courage. They are cunning and cruel, ambitious to
the bitter end. Many of the Dyanir have no morale and they worship the
dark and chaotic gods. Average Dyanir male is around 195 cm tall and
weight goes around 65 kg. The Dyanir live an average of 350 long years.
