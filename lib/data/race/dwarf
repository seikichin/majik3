Dwarves are a small, hardy, and taciturn race. They barely grow to be
140 cm tall. They weigh more than it would appear, around 70 kg in average.
Their body is stocky and their endurance is legendary. Dwarves are
especially proud of their long beards and their great craftsmanship with
metals. The dwarven race has spawned the greatest of all smiths. Their 
skill in forging weapons and armor is unsurpassed, as is their greed for
gold. They are able warriors, brave to the fault, have excellent sight
underground, and are experts at detecting secret doors and traps. Ledend
says that Dwarves have been born of stone, naming them as Sons and 
Daughters of the Earth. Dwarves tend to have black or brown hair.
They usually live far longer than humans, the average lifespan being 
around 200 years.
