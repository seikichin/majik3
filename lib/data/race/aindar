The Aindar are sometimes referred to as the 'high elves'. They have
raven-black hair, brown, black or hazel eyes, and often pale fair skin.
They tend to have a heavier bone and muscle structure than other elven
races. Warriors from the other elven tribes are no match for an Aindar 
in battle. They are the artisans, creators and master workers of the elven
race. Many of the Aindar are skilled gem cutters, smiths, architechts or
other highly prized professionals. They tend to be almost as good as 
dwarves in the creation and manipulation of alloys. Their egos are also
unsurpassed among elves and mortal men. As a result the Aindar elves
are often considered arrogant and condescending by other people.
The Aindar show little desire to conquer other races, instead they
seem content to flaunt their superiority. Aindar are the best
elven fighters and formidable spell casters. The average Aindar male is
around 205 cm tall and weighs around 85 kg. Aindar live an average
of 400 years.
