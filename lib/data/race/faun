The faun are very few in number, a legendary race often loved by women, 
yet feared and hated by men. All fauns are male, it simply seems
impossible for a faun to be female. Fauns are human-sized humanoids with
the legs of a goat. Some have their entire lower body formed like a goat
but some only have the hooves of a goat in the place of their feet. 
Still some fauns even have normal mannish feet and legs, but they
all have small goat horns on their heads. The horns vary from 2-3 cm
to as long as 40-50 cm. Fauns live in the warm fields and forests,
they wear little or no clothing, and can run almost twice as fast a human.
Since fauns are all male, they mate with the females of other races,
humans or elves. If the child is a boy there is only a small change from
him to his father. Fauns are very handsome in a boyish way (no beard or
facial hair). They have the upper body of a perfect adonis, which is very
notorious among human men. Fauns spend alot of time hunting women and 
they seem to love that 'hobby' above all else. An average faun is 185 cm
tall and weighs around 100 kg. Fauns live a long time, and average of 210
years. They appear young and handsome all their lives and die looking young.
