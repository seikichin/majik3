They are known to others as the 'wood elves'. They are a bit
shorter than the other elven races, yet they are somewhat more
human-like in appearance, when compared to their cousins of
greater blood. They still look very elven, with their pointed
ears and delicate features. The Tanir prefer to live close to 
nature in her unaltered state. They build beautiful cities in 
the vast forests of the world. Their respect for nature and
animal-kind is great, they almost never kill animals except when
needed for food and they never destroy the plants or trees of 
the forests. They make for excellent druids, rangers or even 
shamans. Many of the Tanir are skilled with bows and long swords.
Plus, like all the other elven races, tend to be good spell casters. 
Tanir are by far the most common tribe of elven people. They 
resemble the image that most other races have about the elven folk.
An average Tanir is around 190 cm tall, females are generally 10 cm 
shorter than males. The average weight is around 65 kgs, elves do not
weigh much. Tanir generally have brown hair and green or blue eyes.
The Tanir have an average lifespan of about 300 years.
