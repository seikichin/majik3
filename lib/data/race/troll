Trolls are huge and extremely strong creatures, with large muscles, pointy
teeth, big horns and lots of hair all over their body. They are almost
always in a bad mood, and most races shun them because of this. They are 
by far the strongest and maybe dumbest race in the whole world. They make 
for excellent fighters but lousy magicians. Trolls are somewhat at a
disadvantage because of their great size (good targets), and the great 
amounts of food they need to sustain their bulk. They also learn quite 
slowly. On the positive side, they are very tough and strong and heal 
very fast. Also, they are very ugly. An average Troll is around 260 cm
tall and weighs around 210 kg. They are known to have a lifespan of
around 55 years.
