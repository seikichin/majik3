The Lindor are few in number, but it makes them even more noteworthly.
They are known as the 'fair elves', the most noble of all elven
races. They are more philosophical and magical in their nature
than the Aindar. They have golden-blond hair, blue or green eyes
and fair beautiful skin. Tending to be lean and fair yet strong,
the Lindor have an understated natural strength. Lindor are perhaps
the most powerful spell casters of all the elven races. They are very 
musical and tend to create beautiful things (and tend to be very beautiful 
things). Their beauty is legendary, and are often adored by the lesser 
races. They build their homes of a very airy design, filled with light 
and warmth. They enjoy fine wine, food, music, romance and a good time.
In most areas the lesser elves hold as their own, the Lindor
are the ruling upper-class of aristocrats. The Lindor are tall,
around 195 cm. Females are not much shorter than males, making the
Lindor women look majestic. They weigh around 55 kgs and live an 
average of 450 years.
