The most common of all humanoid races, the Thari are everywhere, often
called 'the common men'. They are a mixture of several racial subgroups.
The appearance and measurements of the Thari people vary greatly. Most of
them have brown hair and fair skin, with eyes of any color. The Thari
do not consider themselves a group, since there exists such a variety 
among them and they live all over the world. Being the most generic
race, they tend to be adaptable, suited for every profession. Thari 
people live an average of 70 years, but the Thari in certain regions, 
with some weird racial mixture are known to live over 150 years. So 
the average age really is around 100 years and the average height
of a male is a bit less than 170 cm. Their weight is around 65 kg.
