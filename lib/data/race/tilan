This group has sometimes been referred to as 'high men'. They are 
usually somewhat taller and heavier boned than Elves, but otherwise 
carry a measure of that immortal grace. They have dark hair and 
grey or blue eyes. The Tilans make excellent warriors and powerful 
spellcasters. They tend to be highly resistant to diseases and live 
a long, healthy life. The number of Tilans in the world is quite small,
having fallen far from their glory of ancient times, but they are still 
a powerful race, feared and adored by other mortal men. An average Tilan 
male is around 190 cm tall with an athletic build. Their weight is 90 kg 
on average. They are known to live about 150 years. Tilans have spread 
among other lesser races and hold only few larger areas under their 
control, which are what is left of the great Tilan empire from ancient 
times long ago.
