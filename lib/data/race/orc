Orcs belong to the dark races, created in the same dark pits as trolls. 
They are the arch enemies of many of the intelligent races, as they 
reproduce quickly and enjoy plundering, killing and spreading havoc in 
general. The average orc is 190 cm tall, weighs around 105 kg and has 
grey to black colored skin. Their eyes glow red in the dark. Orcs shun
sunlight, as it tends to hurt their eyes greatly. Because orcs mostly 
live in the underground they are very good at detecting secret doors.
Orcs make for good fighters and are also known to spawn mighty priests,
serving their cruel war deity. The orcs have an average lifespan of
around of 100 years, unfortunately it's very rare for an orc to live 
over 40 years.
