Halflings are happy little people, almost like human children. They
are very dextrous and are able to produce fine objects of skill and art.
They live in their own villages, leading rather simple lives. Some of 
the halflings also reside in larger cities, making their living as 
carpenters or other masters of fine and accurate craftmanship. Some say 
the halflings are very skilled thieves and are responsible for the 
dissapearance of many valuable items. The average halfling is 115 cm 
tall and weighs around 60 kg, appearing maybe a little overweight. 
Halflings live an average of 100 years.
