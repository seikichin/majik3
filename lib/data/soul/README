This file explains how to add and change feelings.

The feelings are located in /data/soul/feelings.
 (Please remember to keep feelings in alphabetical order to avoid confusion.) 

The format of the feeling config-string can hopefully be understood by the aid 
of following examples and their explanations:
 
 Here's an example feeling:
  
    smile::{smile} [HOW|happily]( at WHO||).
  
 And how it works:
  
  First there is the name of the feeling (also the command for it).
  All verbs must be closed in {}'s.
  
   [HOW|happily]
     HOW is replaced by adverb given by player, or if adverb is not given,
      string on the right side of the '|' is used as a default.
      
   ( at WHO||)
     WHO is replaced by target given by player, or if target is not given,
     string between the two '|'s is used as a default.
     If you want the feeling only to work with a target, you must put a '$'
     in the default slot:
        ( at WHO|$|)
     If you want the target-string to be possessive you must put a 's$' or 
     a 'S$' in the extra slot. 's$' means that possessive will be used if
     a body-part is given as an argument and 'S$' causes target-string to
     always be possessive.
     
     Another example:
     
     kick::{kick} (WHO|$|) [HOW|angrily]< in the WHERE|>.
      WHERE will be replaced if body_part is given, otherwise the right side
      of the '|' will replace everything between '<' and '|'. If target is
      not living everything between <>'s will be ignored.
      
     Using #P and #O
     
       #P is replaced by 'your' or  'his/her/its'
       #O is replaced be 'you' or 'him/her/it'
     
     Example:
     
     scratch::{scratch} (WHO|THIS$|s$)< WHERE|>[ HOW|].
      If no target is given the output would be like:
       'You scratch yourself.'
      With target is would be:
       'You scratch Harum.'
      Or with target and body-part:
       'You scratch Harum's head.'
      
      Use THIS$ as default-target to make this_player the target. You can
      add $'s anywhere you want to avoid replacing of strings that can occur
      elsewhere in the feeling string. All $'s will be removed.
      
 Study the already existing feelings and if you still cannot make sense of
 them, ask me (Harum) about it, and I will help.
 Add default adverbs as often as you can and remeber defaults can more than
 just a single word.

 And don't forget to compile /daemon/soul.c after you change the feelings-file.
