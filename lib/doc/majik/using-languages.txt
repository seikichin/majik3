USING LANGUAGES IN MAJIK

    Along with selecting the language what monsters and players speak with
    it's now possible to have different language in common text too used 
    in areas (signs for example). The usage is similar to colors:

	^l<language>    changes the current language to `language', ie.
		
        ^l sartog 		changes the current language to `sartog'.
        ^l uruzden		changes the current language to `uruzden'.
	^l 0			disables the language parsing

	     [-- there's no space between ^l and language name --]

    Here's an example: (which might be difficult to understand :))
	
	(sartog): ^lsartog This text is in sartog.
	 (palen): ^lpalen This text is in palen.
	 (choui): ^lchoui This text is in choui.

    Valid languages are
	alande, kvanya, uruzden, draz, ohrim, sartog, grahnik, hgrzag,
	palen, choui, yavahe, ugal, tzhimsal and yiunda.
		
  IMPORTANT NOTE:
  
    If you include special codes (color codes) in your text along with 
    languages, you _MUST_ disable the language parsing with ^l 0 before
    using special codes or they might get scrambled if user is not familiar
    with the language, causing wrong colors or something even worse.
