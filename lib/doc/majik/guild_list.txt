
   List of guilds under construction and who is making those.
   Just to make sure that 2 wizzes are not coding the same guild.
   Unless, of course, you are doing teamwork.

   This file also helps you to see what guilds are on their way and
   what we are missing. Idea is to make alot of different and
   intresting guilds. Exspecially intresting, we cannot possibly
   think of having a guild that is super-boring and just has to
   exits for some idiot pursope, and a guild a newbie cannot play.
   (good example of a bad guild is the conjurers guild in batmud)
