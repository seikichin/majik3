As we have possibility i suggest we change to port 23 that is default
telnet port so most users does not need to specify port at all, just
start telnet session. It is easier. port 22 would be 'telnet' port for
wizzes then, however port 22 is registered for SSH service (SSH Remote
Login Protocol) so wizzes need to use special 'ssh' client to connect
majik's unix service. Otherwise if that is not available then they
can use just plain ftp which i guess is enough. In future low-level
wizzes can special majik-sh available from special `upper' port. We
have also some other special services and the list is following:

majik-i3_tcp    7681/tcp                        # Majik I3 protocol
majik-i3_udp    7682/udp                        # Majik I3 protocol
majik-http      7683/tcp                        # Majik HTTP daemon
majik-ftp       7684/tcp                        # Majik FTP daemon
majik-addr      7685/tcp                        # Majik address server
majik-mak       7686/tcp                        # Majik authentication
majik-shell     7687/tcp                        # Majik secure shell

I3 ports and http port has no use yet. In the future if we code that
http daemon using LPC we can change it's port to default 80. I3 is
intermud protocol that is used if we want to deliver mail, tells or
whatever using some spell to another mud. Also majik-shell is not
quite yet ready :>

The 'lower' ports:

ssh             22/tcp                          # SSH Remote Login Protocol
ssh             22/udp                          # SSH Remote Login Protocol
majik           23/tcp                          # Majik MURPE

Unix users can add those ports to their /etc/services file so then
it is possible to just: "telnet majik.netti.fi majik-shell" if wanted
to connect majik's limited shell. Also netstat displays port numbers
more nicely :>
