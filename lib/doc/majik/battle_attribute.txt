Battle Attribute
----------------

There are six attributes in battle. They are Damage, Defense, Fatique, Offense, Protection and 
Speed. These attributes are affected by three factors: Worn armour, wielded weapons and used 
maneuver. Naked armour ratings are as follows:

	Attribute	Rating		Cost
	Damage:		-3		-6
	Defense:	+3 		6
	Fatique:	+4 		10
	Offense:	+3 		6
	Protection:	-6		-21
	Speed:		+3		6
	
			Total Cost	-1

Positive values are good and negative bad. The costs can be seen from the table below.

Attribute 	Attribute	
Rating		Cost		Calculation notes
0		0		0 = 0
1		1		0 + 1 = 1
2		3		0 + 1 + 2 = 3
3		6		0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
4		10		And so on.
5		15
6		21
7		28
8		36
9		45
10		55

Negative ratings have negative costs.


Battle Attribute Rules
----------------------

Maneuvers, Armours and Weapons are divided into ten difficulty classes. These classes are 
seen from the table below. The table also shows how many attribute points the difficulty 
rating in question gives to the item / maneuver to buy battle attributes.

Difficulty		Attribute
Rating			Points	
Really Easy		0
Very Easy		1
Easy			2
Mediocre		3
Average			4
Remarkable		5
Fairly Difficult	6
Difficult		7
Very Difficult		8
Incredible		9

Difficulty Rating for Armours and Weapons is determined by the monster the object is 	
obtainable. It can also be determined by a quest or other roleplaying thingy.
Difficulty Rating of a Maneuver is determined by the maneuver's training 
difficulty. These can be seen from the table below.

Monster skill	Maneuver	Difficulty	Attribute
Level		Difficulty	Rating		Points
01..10%		1..3		Really Easy	0
11..20%		4..5		Very Easy 	1
21..30%		6..8		Easy 		2
31..40%		9..10		Mediocre	3
41..50%		11..13		Average		4
51..60%		14..15		Remarkable	5
61..70%		16..18		Fair. Diff.	6
71..80%		19..20		Difficult	7
81..90%		21..23		Very Diff.	8
91..100%	24..25		Incredible	9

Here are some examples. The first value is the rating and the value in parenthesis is the cost.

Attribute		Scimitar	Buckler shield	Breastplate
Damage			+3 (3)		-3 (-6)		+0 (0)
Defense			+1 (1)		+3 (6)		-1 (-1)
Fatique			+0 (0)		+1 (1)		-2 (-3)
Offense			+1 (1)		+1 (1)		+0 (0)
Protection		+0 (0)		+0 (0)		+4 (10)
Speed			+2 (3)		+1 (1)		-1 (-1)
Difficulty Rating	Very. Diff.	Mediocre	Remarkable

Attribute		Haste Ring	Brawlers Punch	Elven Bladestorm
Damage			+0 (0)		+0 (0)		+2 (3)
Defense			+3 (6)		+0 (0)		+4 (10)
Fatique			+3 (3)		+0 (0)		+1 (1)
Offense			+3 (6)		+1 (1)		+4 (10)
Protection		-6 (-21)	+0 (0)		-7 (-28)
Speed			+5 (15)		+1 (1)		+4 (10)
Difficulty Rating	Incredible	Easy		Fair. Diff.

Scimitar and Buckler shield are weapons are therefore don't have Protection attribute. 
Breastplate and Haste Ring are armours and therefore don't have Damage attribute. Brawlers 
Punch and Elven Bladestorm are maneuvers and therefore have all attributes.

True Battle Values
------------------

To know the true value of a combat attribute you average the corresponding attribute ratings
(rounded down). In simplified example Felann the Elven Warmaster is using Buckler Shield, 
Scimitar, Haste Ring and Elven Bladestorm. We calculate his Defense attribute. First we 
calculate Weapon Defense.

Scimitar	+1
Buckler:	+3
Sum:		+4
Average:	+2

Felann is only using one piece of armour and therefore the defense is the defense of that 
armour. (Simplified: Unarmed locations also affect battle attributes)

		Defense
Weapons:	+2
Armours:	+3
Bladestorm:	+4
Sum:		9
Average:	9/3=3

So Felann's Defense Rating is 3 when he is using the above combination of weapons, armour 
and with Elven Bladestorm maneuver.
