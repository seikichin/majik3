^c1WIZARDS' GUIDEBOOK TO MAJIK PROGRAMMING^c0			    	[Workroom]

  Once you have gained wizardhood, your first task is to create a workroom
  for yourself. It's the place where you can code in peace.

  Your workroom will be placed as 'workroom.c' in your home directory. For
  testing we'll use our character 'testman' who has recently wizzed.

  An example of minimal workroom.c:
======

  inherit ROOM;				// this is a room object

  create_room()
  {
	set_short("Testman's workroom");
	set_long("This is the room where Testman works. It really looks" +
		" like it were done only for testing purposes.\n");
	set_area("workroom");
  }
======

  After writing the code, you can compile it with command 'cc workroom', and
  if it compiled without errors, you can go into it with command 
  'goto workroom'.
