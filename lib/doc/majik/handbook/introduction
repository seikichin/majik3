WIZARDS' GUIDEBOOK TO MAJIK PROGRAMMING	        		[Introduction]


  This book is mainly targetted for beginning wizards, who don't yet have
  much experience in majik coding. Apart from that, it also functions for 
  a quick reference for more experienced coders.  I have tried to include 
  most important coding subjects and policies here to have all of them in
  one, easily  accessible place.  I  have  also included some of the most 
  important tables that are otherwise only available as data files. 

  Though  I  have written most of the documents,  some documents by other
  wizards have also been included.  Writer can  be  seen at the bottom of 
  each file.
