LANGUAGES.

One thing to slightly increases level of role playing is to add
languages and we will add languages. At least common, elvish and
dwarven, maybe trollish and orcish too. All races speak their own
language in beginning and also know how to speak common. So we
need to decide shall mortals use their own language everytime
when they just type 'say blah' or does they need to type
'say #elvish blah' ? or 'say #common blah' ? Common would be
better choice for novices but it is not realistic! However,
the output of say should look like this after languages implemented:

> say #e moi mita kuuluu

# mortals who not understand elvish would see:
Namhas says 'gahum tuutughh gugguum' in language that you don't understand.

# mortals who know little about it would see (below 10%):
Namhas says in elvish 'gahum tuutughh gugguum'

# mortals who know somewhat about it would see (over 10%):
Namhas says in elvish 'mohu mittuh kuuluum'

# mortals who know it enough
Namhas says in elvish 'moi mita kuuluu' (~45%):

Language skill below 50% is for understanding it and over 50% is
for speaking it. For beginning elf would have elvish at 100% and
common like 75% and all other languages 0%. Or whatever! :>

However some words like 'hungry', 'mine', 'help' and 'money' are
available at lower language skill percent.

Also that funny 'drunk language' from The Old Majik will be implemented.

We need to have language tables to fuck the text example:

//      [ 1]  [2]  [ 3]  [1]  [ 2]  [  3]
({ "a", "ab", "h", "hz", "g", "gk", "gug" })

So then a char is translated to first three chars depending on
the language skill and that last is three are when drunken. For
those who knows the language but char is drunken is different
table. Such table can be like this (it is same for everyone):

//      [1]  [ 2]  [ 3]
({ "a", "a", "uh", "um" })
