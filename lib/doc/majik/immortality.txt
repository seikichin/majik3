MAJIK/GLIB 0.0-alpha0 OFFICIAL WIZARDHOOD APPLICATION

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT WIZARDHOOD
------------------------------------

    In this mud, or in fact in this murpe we do not speak about wizards,
    we speak about immortal beings, demi gods, gods and greater gods.
    Here the immortals must not interact with mortals, at least not
    officially and usually immortals should be invisible to all mortals.

    We have special worship/sacrifice/pray system. Using it mortals can
    interact with gods and ask for favors. All gods will have special
    amount of _divine points_ which determines that how much he/she can
    answer to mortal prayers and how powerful favors he/she can do. The
    gods can get more divine points when mortal sacrifices valuable items
    to that god. Also the base amount of divine points is depended on the
    level of the god, so coding things also affect the power how much
    powerful favors he can do.

    We have 8 levels of immortality (security levels) and total of 100
    minor levels. Below is list:

    LEVEL   | TITLE              | DESCRIPTION
    --------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------
     ... 01 | avatar             | immortal being which don't have sponsor
    02 - 10 | novice demigod     | new immortal being, sponsored by another
    11 - 20 | apprentice demigod | immortal advanced in the coding skills
    21 - 30 | demigod            | demigod, can sponsor other immortals
    31 - 50 | lesser god         | the first god level, access to approve
    51 - 80 | god                | similar to archwizard
    81 - 99 | greater god        | all possible accesses, really high wiz
    100 ... | admin              | the head administrator
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    IMMORTAL LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS
    ---------------------------

    AVATAR
      - no access to use any wiz commands yet, except wiz channel
      - cannot die
      - needs full demigod to sponsor him/her (to teach the basics)

    NOVICE DEMIGOD
      - access to use almost all wiz commands found from /command/immortal/
        directory, no snoop access available yet

    APPRENTICE DEMIGOD
      - now access to all possible commands that wiz below level 51 can use

    DEMIGOD
      - can sponsor avatars to novice demigods, mortals can start
        worshipping demigod but demigods cannot answer to mortal prayers
        nor can build altar for mortals so they can sacrifice

    LESSER GOD
      - the first real god level, they can approve other immortals work,
        and they can read files in other immortal home directories and also
        some other possible special accesses, also they can build altar so
        mortals can worship and sacrifice stuff and they have great powers
        to answer mortal prayers and grand favors

    GOD
      - this level is similar to usual 'archwizard' level, gods can do
        just what they want to, at least almost, they can read all files
        and they can modify/delete *almost* all files, also they have
        more greater power to interact with mortals than lesser gods did

    GREATER GOD
      - there can be only 3 greater gods, for all alignments, this level
        is the most powerful, they can do *anything* and have almost
        *infinite* powers when answering to prayers but normally greater
        gods are enough huge and they don't have time to concentrate
        answering only single mortal prayers, they concentrate on
        bigger subjects

    ADMIN
     - this level is only for the head administrator, Namhas, mortals
       see namhas as greater god but this level is here just because
       it is, admin have same access than greater gods but he can
       also *remove* other greater gods :)
