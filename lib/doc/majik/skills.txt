Skill System
------------
All skills are part of a skill tree. The root is a basic level of a skill
class like: combat or magic. Each branch is more specialized part of
the skill class. For example: melee and distance are branches of combat
tree. Actual skills are at the leaves of the tree. Examples include:
Sword Attack, Sword Parry and Sewing.

Simplified Combat Tree


		Combat
		/     \
	      Melee   Distance
	     /	\
	Attack	Defense
	/   \
      Sword  Mace Attack

Skill Chance
------------
Actual skill chance is average of the skill chances of the leaf and it's
parents. For example: Character's skill chance with Mace Attack would
be (Mace Attack + Attack + Melee + Combat)/4

Skill Advancement
-----------------
If the character uses a skill well (or fails it badly) he gains experience
to that skill. The parent skill of the skill also gains some exp. (Half
of the experience of the children skill) After the skill has gained enough
experience the skill raises by one percent.

Advantage of this system:
As a parent skill advances all the children of this skill advance.
