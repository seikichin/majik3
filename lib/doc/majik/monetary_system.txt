MONETARY SYSTEM IN MAJIK

    
	Unlike many other MUDs,   Majik is not limited into specific money 
	units. There are three basic money types (gold, silver and copper)
	and besides those coders can create their own monetary units.

	The basic unit for money, is BMU (Basic Monetary Unit) in what the
	value of the coins are expressed.  One BMU is very small amount to
	have more space to adjust coin values.  At the moment,  BMU values 
	for common coins are:

		gold florin	-	10000
		silver dime	-	  500
		copper penny    -	   50

	As you can see, gold is very much money and should be rare. Copper
	and silver are used in everyday life.  When creating new coins you
	shouldn't have their BMU value greater than 20-30000.  If you code
	coins  with such  high values,  *think* for a reason to have money 
	unit that expensive.  If you need to express HUGE amounts of money 
	then you  should create gems,  that can be converted into money in 
	mineral stores, instead.

	For examples about  creating money look at the existing coins that
	are in /obj/money/.
