ATTRIBUTES

Once more i've described the replacement for current stat system
implemented by Ondoval. You've possibly noticed that current
stat system is quite boring, all characters of certain race
have *same* stats as other players from that race and also stats
are stepped by number 5, example: 50, 55, 60, 65 - no exceptions.
For monsters we have then stats like 500, 600, 700 etc. I think
that is really unrealistic, bat-like and boring.

I suggest stat system where player characters can have stats
from range 1-99 - in beginning only 3-30. For example starting
human hero would have stats of 100-200 points, about 10-20 points/each
which are randomly calculated. Of course we can set str to be
more powerful for some race and so on but we should set some
maximum and minimum stats for each race so we can stay in tune
but however we have different characters from one race. So in the
config files we would example set the percentage for each stat
as we have 10 stats totally a most generic human would have 10%
for each stat. If we want his/her/its dexterity to be more powerful
than others we could upgrade the percentage and lower other percentages.
Then we set a maximum amount of stats. Then all scores are randomly
calculated and set to random attributes by the rules of the percentages
until the amount of total stats is full. Minimum for each stat however
is 3. Hmm or we should can do like this:

  set_str_percentage (10, 4);

So then str would be 10% and minimum 4. Or possibly:

  set_str_minmax (4, 20);

So then minimum would be 4 and maximum 20 without percentage at all,
need to think about it more. ANYWAY, you got the idea, didn't you?

Maximum stats would be easily calculated by using formula:
m = c + (c*100/t/2) where c is current stat and t is total stats
and m is maximum stat. Also in future in the game there should
be some ways to improve the maximum stat.

In that system we would have more space for stat advancement
and +1stat eqs should make some effect unlike in old system
where only +5stat eqs, usually better have some effect.

Let's take some examples, a generic human fighter in Ondoval's stat
system is:

str 50 / -1
agi 50 / -1
dex 50 / -1
con 50 / -1
stu 50 / -1
int 50 / -1
wis 50 / -1
pow 50 / -1
cha 50 / -1
siz 50 / -1

total: 500

In the new system a generic human fighter would be example:

str 18 / 24
agi 13 / 18
dex 14 / 19
con 19 / 26
stu 16 / 22
int 10 / 14
wis 13 / 18
pow 20 / 27
cha  6 /  8
siz 12 / 16

total: 141

Ok, we need new hp/sp/ep formulaes, there they are:

  hp: ((siz*2)+(str/2)+(pow/3)+(con/2)+(stu*3))*2 == 194
  sp: ((pow*2)+(int/2)+(wis/2))*2                 == 103
  ep: (str+(con*2)+(dex/2))*2                     == 126

For regen we need a racial hb tick, so some races have faster
heart beat and some slower, so for those with faster has
really a faster regen too. Special formulae for regen of course.

I've thinked also some descs for stats:

str for human:
  
  0-5   sickly weak
  5-7   weak
  8-9   rather weak
  10-12 average
  13-15 rather strong
  16-17 quite strong
  18-21 strong
  21-23 very strong
  24+   extremely strong

Nah, someone else can think about those descriptions :>

But, First, We need to decide if we use ondoval's old stat
system or replace it with mine? Also we need to dedice how
we do those stat descriptions, by percentage of minmax or
what? You know, for weak race str 8 is maybe strong but
for troll it is sickly weak. Also as we are quite decided to
do automagical long descriptions for player characters,
should we compare the beholder's stat to target stat and
then say if it is stronger or weaker or do we just use some
generic table to determine description. Me thinks we also
should not add description at all if the stat is just average,
it is rather boring to see: "He is a average human male with average
muscles and looks averagenly agile and average this and that." To
improve quality of descriptions we should also add hair/eye colors
and possibly beard too and then we should let 'em to be long
or short or whatever. Some special things to description is added
then by going some shop and buying it. Taking new color to hair,
cutting hair off and such. We need fucking many descriptions for
everything and many different hair styles and colors to improve
diversity. It is very bad if we see two same descriptions. All
players should be rather unique :) -- By Ondoval's system it
does not work!

                              ++ Namhas, suggestions very welcome.
