                    Evil (x-axis)
Legend:
B = black, R = red, Y = yellow, G = green
W = white, O = brown, U = blue

If you haven't already read the color_align_sys.txt, read that
before this because this is just an appendix to it.

So, this chart represents the "positions" of certain colors in the
alignment system on good - evil axis and on law - chaos axis.
These "values" each color have represent how 'evil' or 'good' and how
'lawful' or 'chaotic' each color is. The smaller the value in good-evil
axis, the more evil it is, and the smaller the number in law-chaos axis,
the more chaotic it is, and vice versa.
For example, B (black) is 1,4 (x,y) so it is very 'evil' and a bit
chaotic and U (blue) is 4,8 so it is only a bit 'evil' but pretty lawful
alignment.
So, the meaning of this chart is that currently, alignment is based on two
values: good - evil axis value and law - chaos axis value. This chart
gives you more info bout the color_alignment_system that i have designed
and hopefully will help you understand that system fully. I will be working
on this new alignment system as soon as i am capable of.

Setting alignment.
Because alignment is based on two values, you need to set them both.
Command set_alignx sets your good - evil alignment and set_aligny sets your
order - chaos alignment. Scale is from 1500 to -1500. Neutral "zone" is
from 500 to -500. Setting of your alignment is seen in 'who' list.
For mortals, color-based alignment system is used. When they choose a race
default align will be set (and hopefully there will be some little random
or choosable factor which also affects) and this alignment is shown either
in one color or a combination of colors depending on the values of alignx
and aligny. Because the alignment system varies from 1500 to -1500 i shall
make a table where color-alignment values can be compared to the real
values.

Note that values are _average_ values and are given in 'x,y' order.

           Value 
 Color   | in chart | Real value
------------------------------------
Black    | 1 ,  4   | -1350 , -400
Red      | 3 ,  3   |  -750 , -750
Yellow   | 6 ,  1   |   200 , -1350
White    | 9 , 10   |  1050 ,  1350
Green    | 9 ,  4   |  1050 , -400 
Blue     | 4 ,  8   |  -400 ,  750
Brown    | 6 ,  8   |   200 ,  750
