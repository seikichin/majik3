QUESTS                                             MAJIK MUDLIB DOCUMENTATION

    This is the document that describes the functionality of quest system in
	Majik. Quest system is inherited into player object and can be used with 
	the following functions.
	
  void begin_quest(string quest_name)
    Makes the quest active, or if it already is active the quest will be 
	restarted. Please use unique enough quest names because we don't want
	conflicting quest names. I can assure you that heavy bugging occurs
	if that happens.
  
  int finish_quest(string quest_name)
    Finishes a quest. Quest will be marked as `completed' when this function
	is called.
	
  int is_quest_finished(string quest_name)
    Returns 1 if specific quest has been completed.
	
  int is_quest_active(string quest_name)
    Returns 1 if quest has been set active with begin_quest(). Useful when
	you don't want the quest to be completed without first starting it :).
	
  mixed set_quest_status(string quest_name, mixed status)
    You can store any information related to your quest with this function.
	As status is of mixed type this field can contain _anything_. Very useful
	if your quest has different `parts' that have to be completed in order.
	
  mixed query_quest_status(string quest_name)
    Returns the status information related with quest, if any.
