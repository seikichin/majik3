MATERIAL SYSTEM ON MAJIK                          


Materials on Majik are handled by material daemon (/daemon/material.c)
which keeps track on available materials and their properties (values,
  weights etc). 

Currently, materials have following properties (more will be added in future):

name          - name of the material
price         - how much one kg of this material is worth in gold
weight        - how much 1 dm3 (1 liter) of this material weighs
burnfactor    - how many kg's of this material burns each minute

Some basic materials are defined in /daemon/material.c, where more of these
can be easily added. You can also add more materials in your code by calling
add_material(string name, int price, int weight, int burnfactor). 

Example:

create_item()
{
    ...

    find_object(MATERIAL_D)->add_material("ruby", 100, 2, 0);
        set_material("ruby");
        
        ...
}


Items can also have multiple materials. They can be set by giving arguments to
set_material in material : percentage pairs as mapping, ie. 

set_material(([ "steel" : 80, "leather" : 20 }));

All comments are very welcome.
