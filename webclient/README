This Web client is specifically written for Majik 3 MUD for supporting
the special color codes used by the game engine. It is also just as
barebones as needs to be for the game.

For setting up WebSockets, you could use websocketd or use FluffOS's
native WebSocket support.

The wss:// or ws:// can be configured from webclient.js .
